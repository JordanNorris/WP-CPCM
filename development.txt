== Environment setup ==

Development with VVV (varyingvagrantvagrants.org)
Install VirtualBox: disable your virusscanner or Vagrant won't work!
Install Vagrant for Windows.
Follow rest of the directions at varyingvagrantvagrants.org

When you've made code changes, run `vagrant up --provision`

== Unit tests ==

First time use, check this blog post for troubleshooting: https://tilcode.blog/2019/10/14/adding-unit-tests-to-a-wordpress-plugin-via-vvv-and-phpunit/

Run the following 
- `vagrant ssh` to access the environment that is running the WordPress development sites.
- `mysqladmin create wordpress_test --user=wp --password=wp --host=localhost`
- `cd /srv/www/wordpress-one` (does not show up with `ls` command but it's there!
- `cd public_html/wp-content/plugins/category-posts-in-custom-menu/`
- Download phpunit version 7 with wget (8 is not supported)
	- wget -O phpunit https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-7.phar
	- chmod +x phpunit
- `./phpunit` to run the tests for the plugin
